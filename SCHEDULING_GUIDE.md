### Managing Permissions

#### Android 13+ Notification Permission
The app will automatically request notification permission when you create a schedule.

#### Exact Alarms (Android 12+)
For precise timing, enable "Exact Alarms" in system settings:
1. Go to Settings > Apps > Med Tracker
2. Find "Alarms & Reminders" or "Exact Alarms"
3. Enable the permission

#### Battery Optimization (Recommended)
For reliable notifications on some devices (Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei):
1. Disable battery optimization for Med Tracker
2. Allow "Autostart" for the app
3. This ensures notifications fire even in deep sleep

## üîß Technical Details

### Notification Architecture
- **Service**: `notification_service.dart` handles all notification logic
- **Scheduling**: Uses `flutter_local_notifications` with timezone support
- **Firestore Integration**: Schedules are saved to `users/{userId}/schedules`
- **History Logging**: Events logged to `users/{userId}/history`

### Firestore Data Structure

#### Medicine Document
```json
{
  "name": "Aspirin",
  "dosage": "100 mg",
  "frequency": "Daily",
  "description": "Pain relief",
  "startDate": "2025/01/01",
  "endDate": "2025/12/31",
  "initialStock": 30,
  "illness": "Headache",
  "createdAt": Timestamp
}
```

#### Schedule Document
```json
{
  "medicineName": "Aspirin",
  "dosage": "100 mg",
  "time": "9:00 AM",
  "days": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"],
  "interval": "Daily",
  "createdAt": Timestamp
}
```

#### History Document
```json
{
  "medicineName": "Aspirin",
  "status": "Reminder",
  "timestamp": Timestamp
}
```

### Firestore Security Rules
The `firestore.rules` file ensures:
- Users can only access their own data
- Required fields are validated
- Data types are enforced
- Status values are restricted to valid options

## üß™ Testing
