# 🚀 Enhanced Notification System for Android 12-14

## ✅ What's New

### **1. Multi-Layer Notification System**
- **Primary**: Flutter Local Notifications with exact alarms
- **Fallback**: WorkManager for background tasks
- **Backup**: Automatic stock reduction when notifications fire

### **2. Android 12-14 Specific Fixes**
- ✅ Full permission handling (notification, exact alarm, battery optimization)
- ✅ Multiple notification channels (high priority & urgent)
- ✅ Full-screen intent support for critical reminders
- ✅ WorkManager fallback for OEM-restricted devices

### **3. Beautiful UI Redesign**

## 🔔 How Notifications Work Now

### **Three-Tier System:**

1. **Tier 1: Exact Alarms (Primary)**
   - Uses `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle`
   - Fires at exact scheduled time
   - Full-screen intent for critical alerts
   - LED lights, vibration, and sound

2. **Tier 2: WorkManager (Fallback)**
   - Runs even on battery-restricted devices
   - Survives app closure and device restart
   - More reliable on Oppo/Xiaomi/Huawei devices
   - Periodic task that checks schedule

3. **Tier 3: Automatic Stock Reduction**
   - If notification fires, stock reduces by 1
   - Tracks medicine intake automatically
   - Creates history log for each auto-reduction
   - Works as passive tracking method

## 📱 Android Version Support

- ✅ Full notification permission handling
- ✅ Exact alarm permission request
- ✅ Foreground service permissions

### **Android 13 (API 33)**

## 🧪 Testing Steps
